I'm excited to share my latest project, **BetterMe** — a self-improvement app designed to help you build lasting habits and achieve your goals.

I built this application from scratch to challenge myself with full-stack development and AI integration. It's not just a todo list; it's a smart companion that keeps you motivated!

**🔍 Key Features:**

✅ **AI Coach Integration**: Uses **Google Gemini API** to provide personalized daily motivation and habit tips.
✅ **Gamification**: Earn badges and achievements (System designed with custom logic!).
✅ **Secure Auth**: Full registration flow with Email Verification using Spring Security & JWT.
✅ **Responsive UI**: A polished React frontend with dark/light themes.

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
*   **Backend**: Java Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL (running in Docker)
*   **Frontend**: React.js, Vite
*   **AI**: Google Gemini Pro Model
*   **DevOps**: Docker & Docker Compose
